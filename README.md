## Host PC CNN Training 
### 1. Train CNN Model
- Define and train a CNN model.
- Save as keras file.

### 2. Download and Prepare Dataset
- Download the MNIST dataset from Kaggle.
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Save the dataset as a pickle file.

### 3. Convert to TensorFlow Lite
- Convert the trained CNN model to TensorFlow Lite (tflite) format.

## Files
- `pickle_conv.py` – Pickle convertor.
- `tflite_conv.py` – Keras to tflite convertor.
