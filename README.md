## CNN Training 
### 1. Train CNN Model
- Define and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- Save as keras file.

### 2. Download and Prepare Dataset
- Download the MNIST dataset from Kaggle.
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Save the dataset as a pickle file.

### 3. Convert to TensorFlow Lite
- Convert the trained CNN model to TensorFlow Lite (tflite) format.

## Files
- `mnist_data.pkl` – Pickle convertor.
- `model.tflite` – Keras to tflite convertor.
